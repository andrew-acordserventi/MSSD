# Masters-in-Software-Development

Currently seeking an entry-level developer or engineer position. Remote, or near Corpus Christi, TX only (cannot relocate).

Building this repo to show potential employers samples of what I have worked on and coded over the past 2 years during my Master's in Software Development.

My degree included 9 courses:

CS300 - Into to Software Development. Mostly computer systems and discrete mathematics, with basic Python programming.

CS521 - Information Structures in Python. Data types, classes, arrays, strings, Object oriented programming, control structures, loops, methods, inheritance, polymorphism, exceptions, streams, etc. Taught in Python.

CS526 - Data Structures and Algorithms. Computational problem solving, data structures, algorithms, runtime analysis (Big O), etc. Taught in Java.

CS622 - Advanced Programming Techniques. Polymorphism, containers, libraries, method specifications, large-scale code management, use of exceptions, concurrent programming, functional programming, programming tests. Taught in Java.

CS665 - Design Patterns. Object Oriented programming design patterns, such as factory pattern, strategy pattern, adapter pattern, etc. Taught in Java.

CS673 - Software Engineering. Agile and DevOps. Basically a big group project with multiple developers developing a single, large project.

CS601 - Web Application Development (front-end). HTML, CSS, Javascript, HTML5, JSON, Vue.

CS602 - Server-side Web Development (back-end). PHP, MySQL, MVC, Node.js, Express.js.

CS669 - Database Design and Implementation for Business. Microsoft SQL server and Oracle SQL. Database creation, SQL data types, processes, triggers, queries, etc. Database design with Crow's Foot and UML.

Additionally, my Master's included so much more. This is only a small fraction of what I learned and worked on. Some of which I have not included (such as CS300 - it's too basic and a lot of the work didn't include programming, rather it was concepts in discrete math and computer systems) and some of which I cannot include (copyrighted materials owned by the university, tests, quizzes, discussions, and much more). All told, this repo contains about 25% of what I worked on to attain my Master's.

Some of the code files may be difficult to understand what the aim of the code is. Unfortunately, I cannot include many assignment details that state "Create a program that does X, with Y constraints" that outline what the particular problem being solved is aimed at. This is to avoid copyright infringement and any claims of acadamic information violation (ie, copying). I have only included the code and work that I have personally created.

Additionally, 2 of the courses (CS601 and CS673) were heavily project based. Instead of uploading all the files, I have included links to the websites where the applications can be found.
